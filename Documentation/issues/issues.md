# Things to fix
These are the issues that i observed that require attentions. They may be only on my machine but they also may be a general problem

## Desktop environments specific
### Chromium doesn't open on kde x11
- on kde wayland it is not a problem
- Possible ideas: N/A 

### Hyprland gestures
- related file `home-manager/modules/hyprland/main.ni
  - I tried with the following code but didn´t work 
- see https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Gestures/

```nix
 gestures = {
          workspace_swipe = true;
          workspace_swipe_invert = false;
          workspace_swipe_forever = true;
        };

        gesture = [
          "3, horizontal, workspace"
        ];
```


### Cosmic does not build
- I want to use the alpha channel the unstable one but it does not build.
  - I tried to both include and remove the pkgs follow for both stable and unstable channel, as well as manually updating and removing the lock file prior to building again. All of these did not solve teh problems 

## General
### During rebuild: 'system' has been renamed to/replaced by 'stdenv.hostPlatform.system'
- I tried but didn't found a proper way to handle it
- Modifying `flake.nix` should be enough




## Guest user specific
### User remains active in tty*
- When the guest log in a session where it is not allowed and the kickout script run then if the main user tries to reboot via cli it is greeted with a warning
- The guest user is still logged in tty*, there are as many tty as many times the script runned, 1 per desktop environment
  - This means if the user did 2 wrong login (hyprland + kde wayland) for example it would still be logged in tty1 and tty2
- The main user is then prompted to run systemctl reboot -i
  - This solve the problem and the pc actually boot, but it should be ideally logged out completely 
- The guest kickout script are handled in `guest.nix`, `hyprland.nix` and `kde.nix`
